üöÄ **Quick Start Guide**

Get your ALX Student Showcase up and running in minutes\!

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * Node.js (v18 or higher)
  * npm (Node Package Manager)
  * A Supabase account (free tier is sufficient)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd alx-student-showcase
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # If you encounter ERESOLVE errors, try: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Set up your Supabase Project:**

      * Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and create a new project.
      * Navigate to **Settings \> API** to find your **Project URL** and **Anon Key**.
      * Open your Supabase SQL Editor and run the database schema provided in `supabase-schema.txt`. This will create your `users` and `projects` tables, along with Row Level Security (RLS) policies and triggers.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

      * Create a copy of the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.local.example .env.local
        ```
      * Open `.env.local` and update it with your Supabase credentials:
        ```
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
        # Optional: For GitHub API rate limit increase (recommended for import feature)
        # VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
        ```
        Replace `"YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"` and `"YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"` with your actual values.
        For `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`, generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `public_repo` scope on GitHub if you plan to use the GitHub import feature extensively.

5.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Your application will now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

6.  **Build for Production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command compiles the application into the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

üìä **Database Schema**

The core database schema is defined in `supabase-schema.txt` and includes:

  * `users` table: Stores extended user profiles (full name, ALX ID, GitHub username, LinkedIn URL, bio, etc.) linked to Supabase Auth users.
  * `projects` table: Houses detailed documentation for each student project, including title, description, technologies, URLs, categories, and ALX-specific metadata.

**Key Database Features:**

  * **Row Level Security (RLS):** Ensures data privacy and proper access control.
  * **Automatic Profile Creation:** A database trigger automatically creates a `users` entry upon new user sign-up via Supabase Auth.
  * **Optimized Indexes:** For efficient data retrieval and performance.
  * `updated_at` timestamps: Triggers automatically update timestamps on record modifications.
