# Authentication System Documentation

This document outlines the design, implementation, and usage of the authentication system within the ALX Showcase application. It covers both frontend (React/Redux) and backend (Supabase) aspects, focusing on secure, intuitive, and minimalist user experiences.

## 1\. Overview

The authentication system provides secure user registration (Sign Up) and login (Sign In) functionalities. It leverages Supabase as the backend authentication service and integrates seamlessly with a React frontend using Redux Toolkit for state management. Key features include client-side validation, responsive UI, loading states, and persistent user sessions.

## 2\. Technologies Used

  * **React:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
  * **Redux Toolkit:** State management library for managing authentication state globally.
  * **React Router DOM:** For client-side routing and navigation.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling.
  * **Shadcn UI:** Reusable UI components built with Tailwind CSS.
  * **Supabase Auth:** Backend-as-a-Service for user authentication, handling user data, password hashing, and session management.
  * **Sonner:** A toast library for user feedback (notifications).
  * **Lucide React:** Icon library for UI elements (e.g., password visibility toggle, loading spinner).

## 3\. Setup Instructions

To get the authentication system running, ensure you have the following configured:

### 3.1. Supabase Project Setup

1.  **Create a Supabase Project:** If you haven't already, create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
2.  **Enable Email Authentication:**
      * Navigate to **Authentication \> Settings** in your Supabase project dashboard.
      * Ensure "Email Signups" is **ON**.
      * For development, you can set "Email Confirm" to **OFF** for immediate sign-in without email verification. **Remember to set this to ON for production.**
3.  **Get Supabase Credentials:**
      * Go to **Project Settings \> API**.
      * Note down your `Project URL` and `anon public` key.

### 3.2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project's root directory and add the following:

```dotenv
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY"
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials.

### 3.3. Dependencies Installation

Ensure you have all necessary npm packages installed:

```bash
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit @supabase/supabase-js tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer sonner lucide-react
npm install -D vite @vitejs/plugin-react # If using Vite
# Install Shadcn UI components as per its documentation if you haven't already.
# e.g., npx shadcn-ui@latest add button input label card
```

## 4\. Frontend Implementation Details

### 4.1. `src/lib/supabase.js`

This file initializes the Supabase client using your environment variables.

```javascript
// src/lib/supabase.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

### 4.2. `src/store/slices/authSlice.js` (Redux Toolkit Slice)

This Redux slice manages the global authentication state (`user`, `isLoading`, `error`) and handles interactions with Supabase Auth via async thunks.

  * **State:**
      * `user: null | object`: Stores the Supabase user object if authenticated, otherwise `null`.
      * `isLoading: boolean`: Indicates if an authentication operation is in progress.
      * `error: null | string`: Stores an error message from the last authentication attempt.
  * **Reducers:**
      * `setUser(state, action)`: Sets the `user` state to the payload (Supabase user object).
      * `setLoading(state, action)`: Toggles the `isLoading` state.
      * `setError(state, action)`: Sets the `error` state.
      * `clearAuth(state)`: Resets the entire authentication state to its initial values (useful on logout).
  * **Async Thunks:**
      * `signUp({ email, password })`: Dispatches a sign-up request to Supabase. On success, `setUser` is dispatched. On error, `setError` is dispatched and a `sonner` toast is shown.
      * `signIn({ email, password })`: Dispatches a sign-in request to Supabase. On success, `setUser` is dispatched. On error, `setError` is dispatched and a `sonner` toast is shown.
      * `signOut()`: Dispatches a sign-out request to Supabase. On success, `clearAuth` is dispatched.
  * **`extraReducers`:** Handles the `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected` states of the async thunks to update `isLoading`, `user`, and `error`.

### 4.3. `src/components/auth/SignUpPage.jsx`

This component provides the user interface for new user registration.

  * **Form Handling:** Uses `useState` for `email`, `password`, and `confirmPassword` inputs.
  * **Client-Side Validation:**
      * Email format validation (`validateEmail` function).
      * Real-time password matching validation between `password` and `confirmPassword`.
      * Error messages are displayed inline below the input fields.
  * **Redux Integration:** Dispatches the `authSlice.signUp` thunk on form submission.
  * **Loading State:** The 'Create Account' button displays a loading spinner and is disabled while `isLoading` is true.
  * **Error Feedback:** General authentication errors from Redux are displayed via `sonner` toasts or an inline message at the top of the form.
  * **Navigation:** Contains a `Link` to the `/signin` page for existing users.
  * **Styling:** Utilizes Shadcn `Card`, `Label`, `Input`, `Button` components and Tailwind CSS for a clean, minimalist 'tech UI/UX' aesthetic. Includes a password visibility toggle.

### 4.4. `src/components/auth/SignInPage.jsx`

This component provides the user interface for existing user login.

  * **Form Handling:** Uses `useState` for `email` and `password` inputs.
  * **Redux Integration:** Dispatches the `authSlice.signIn` thunk on form submission.
  * **Loading State:** The 'Sign In' button displays a loading spinner and is disabled while `isLoading` is true.
  * **Error Feedback:** Authentication errors from Redux are displayed via `sonner` toasts or an inline message at the top of the form.
  * **Redirection:** After successful sign-in (`authSlice.user` is populated), the user is automatically redirected to the `/dashboard` page using `useNavigate`.
  * **Navigation:** Includes `Link`s to the `/signup` page for new users and a 'Forgot Password?' link.
  * **Styling:** Consistent with the `SignUpPage`, using Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS. Includes a password visibility toggle.

### 4.5. `src/App.jsx` (Root Component & Routing)

This is the main application component responsible for setting up the router, integrating Redux, and managing the global Supabase authentication listener.

  * **Redux Provider:** The application is wrapped with `ReactRedux.Provider` in `main.jsx` (or `index.js`) to make the Redux store available.
  * **Supabase Authentication Listener (`useEffect`):**
      * `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()`: Sets up a real-time listener for changes in the Supabase authentication state (e.g., user logs in, logs out, session refreshes).
      * When a session is active, it dispatches `authSlice.setUser(session.user)` to update the Redux state.
      * When no session is active (e.g., logout), it dispatches `authSlice.clearAuth()`.
      * This listener is crucial for maintaining persistent login across page refreshes and browser sessions.
      * Includes a cleanup function (`subscription.unsubscribe()`) to prevent memory leaks.
      * An initial `supabase.auth.getSession()` check ensures the Redux state is accurate on app load.
  * **React Router DOM Routes:**
      * Defines public routes (`/`, `/signup`, `/signin`, `/forgot-password`).
      * Defines protected routes (e.g., `/dashboard`) using the `ProtectedRoute` wrapper component.
  * **`ProtectedRoute` Component:**
      * A higher-order component that checks the Redux `auth.user` state.
      * If `user` is `null` (not authenticated), it redirects the user to the `/signin` page using `useNavigate`.
      * If `user` exists, it renders the child components (e.g., `Dashboard`).
      * Includes a loading screen to prevent flickering while authentication status is being determined.
  * **Sonner Toaster:** Integrated globally to display success and error messages across the application.

## 5\. Backend Configuration (Supabase)

Supabase handles the majority of backend authentication tasks.

### 5.1. Supabase Authentication Settings

  * **Email Signups:** Must be enabled in your Supabase project's Authentication -\> Settings.
  * **Email Confirm:** For development, you can disable this. For production, **it is strongly recommended to enable email confirmation** to verify user email addresses and prevent spam/abuse.

### 5.2. Security Considerations

Supabase significantly simplifies authentication security by handling critical aspects:

  * **Password Hashing:** Supabase automatically hashes all user passwords using strong, salted algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) before storing them. Passwords are never stored in plain text.
  * **Rate Limiting:** Supabase's authentication endpoints have built-in rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.
  * **Secure Data Transmission:** All communication between your frontend and Supabase uses HTTPS, ensuring encrypted data in transit.
  * **Session Management (JWTs):** Supabase uses secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for session management. These tokens are signed and time-limited, providing a robust and scalable authentication mechanism. The Supabase client library securely handles the storage and transmission of these tokens.
  * **Environment Variables:** Supabase API keys (especially the `service_role` key, if used) should always be stored as secure environment variables and never directly committed to public repositories. The `anon` (public) key is safe for client-side exposure.
  * **Password Reset:** Supabase provides built-in, secure password reset functionality that relies on email verification, ensuring only the legitimate user can reset their password.

## 6\. Authentication Flow (User Journey)

1.  **New User (Sign Up):**
      * User navigates to `/signup`.
      * Enters email and password, confirming password.
      * Client-side validation provides immediate feedback.
      * Submits form, `signUp` thunk is dispatched.
      * Loading state is shown on button.
      * If successful, a success toast is displayed. If email confirmation is off, the user might be immediately logged in and redirected to `/dashboard`. If email confirmation is on, they are prompted to check their email.
      * If an error occurs (e.g., email already exists, weak password from backend validation), an error toast/message is displayed.
2.  **Returning User (Sign In):**
      * User navigates to `/signin`.
      * Enters email and password.
      * Submits form, `signIn` thunk is dispatched.
      * Loading state is shown on button.
      * If successful, a success toast is displayed, and the user is redirected to `/dashboard`.
      * If credentials are incorrect, an error toast/message is displayed.
3.  **Session Persistence:**
      * Upon successful sign-in, the Supabase session is stored (e.g., in `localStorage`).
      * When the user revisits the application or refreshes the page, the `App.jsx` `onAuthStateChange` listener and `getSession` call re-authenticates the session with Supabase and updates the Redux state, providing a persistent login experience.
4.  **Protected Routes:**
      * Any attempt to access a `ProtectedRoute` (like `/dashboard`) when unauthenticated will result in an automatic redirection to the `/signin` page.
5.  **Sign Out:**
      * When the user clicks 'Sign Out' (e.g., on the Dashboard), the `signOut` thunk is dispatched.
      * Supabase ends the session, and the Redux state is cleared, typically redirecting the user back to a public route like `/signin` or `/`.
