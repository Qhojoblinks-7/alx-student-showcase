# ALX Showcase Project: Dashboard Module Documentation

## 1\. Overview

The Dashboard (`/dashboard`) serves as the central hub for authenticated users within the ALX Showcase application. It provides a personalized, intuitive, and highly organized interface for students to manage their projects, view statistics, and access profile settings. Designed with a professional aesthetic, it ensures a seamless and responsive user experience across various devices.

**Core Technologies Used:**

  * **Frontend:** React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Lucide React (for icons), React Router DOM (for nested routing).
  * **Backend/Database:** Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL Database, RLS).
  * **Data Sources:** User profile data, project data.

**Key Features:**

  * Responsive layout with persistent header and sidebar navigation.
  * Personalized welcome and at-a-glance summary of project metrics.
  * Dedicated sections for 'My Projects', 'Stats', and 'Profile Settings' via nested routing.
  * Efficient state management with Redux Toolkit.
  * Modern UI components leveraging Shadcn UI.

## 2\. Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built with React, utilizing Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn UI for pre-built, accessible components. Nested routing is handled by React Router DOM.

### 2.1. Component Structure

The Dashboard module is composed of several modular and reusable React components:

  * **`Dashboard.jsx` (Main Layout & Routing)**

      * **Purpose:** Defines the overall two-column layout (sidebar + main content) and manages the nested routing for dashboard sections. It also orchestrates the "Add Project" modal.
      * **Key Responsibilities:**
          * Renders `DashboardHeader` and `DashboardSidebar`.
          * Sets up `react-router-dom`'s `Routes` for `/dashboard/projects`, `/dashboard/stats`, and `/dashboard/profile`.
          * Manages the visibility of the `Add Project` modal using state from `uiSlice`.
      * **Dependencies:** `DashboardHeader`, `DashboardSidebar`, `ProjectList`, `DashboardStats`, `UserProfile`, `Dialog` (Shadcn UI), `uiSlice`.
      * **Protected Route:** Assumes protection is handled by a higher-order component or route wrapper in `App.jsx`, redirecting unauthenticated users.

  * **`DashboardHeader.jsx`**

      * **Purpose:** Provides a persistent top bar for the application.
      * **Key Responsibilities:**
          * Displays the app logo/title.
          * Includes a hamburger menu icon (for mobile) to toggle the sidebar.
          * Features a user avatar with a dropdown menu for quick access to "Profile Settings" and "Logout".
          * Fetches current user's email and name from `authSlice` for display.
      * **Dependencies:** `Link` (react-router-dom), `useSelector` (react-redux), `useDispatch` (react-redux), `signOut` (authSlice), `toggleSidebar` (uiSlice), Shadcn UI `Avatar`, `DropdownMenu`, `Button`, Lucide React icons (`Menu`, `LogOut`, `LayoutDashboard`, `User2`).

  * **`DashboardSidebar.jsx`**

      * **Purpose:** Implements the primary navigation system as a collapsible sidebar on desktop and a sheet/drawer on mobile.
      * **Key Responsibilities:**
          * Renders navigation links (`My Projects`, `Stats`, `Profile Settings`) using `NavLink` from `react-router-dom`.
          * Dynamically styles the active navigation link.
          * Uses Shadcn UI `Sheet` component for a responsive, mobile-friendly sidebar that slides in from the left.
          * Manages its open/close state via `uiSlice`.
      * **Dependencies:** `NavLink`, `useLocation` (react-router-dom), `useSelector`, `useDispatch` (react-redux), `setSidebarOpen` (uiSlice), Shadcn UI `Sheet`, `Button`, Lucide React icons (`LayoutDashboard`, `FolderKanban`, `BarChart2`, `User`, `X`).

  * **`DashboardSummary.jsx`**

      * **Purpose:** Displays a concise overview of the user's projects with key metrics.
      * **Key Responsibilities:**
          * Shows a personalized greeting ("Welcome back, [User's Name]\!").
          * Presents 2-3 key summary metrics (`Total Projects`, `Projects In Progress`, `Last Updated Project`) using `StatsSummaryCard` components.
          * Includes a prominent "Add New Project" button that triggers the `ProjectForm` modal.
          * Consumes project data from the Redux `projectsSlice` (placeholder for now) to calculate statistics.
      * **Dependencies:** `useSelector`, `useDispatch` (react-redux), `toggleAddProjectModal` (uiSlice), `Button` (Shadcn UI), `StatsSummaryCard`, Lucide React icons (`PlusCircle`, `Loader2`).

  * **`src/components/ui/stats-summary-card.jsx`**

      * **Purpose:** A reusable Shadcn UI `Card`-based component for displaying individual summary metrics.
      * **Props:** `title`, `value`, `description` (optional), `icon` (optional, Lucide React icon component).

  * **Placeholder Components (`ProjectList.jsx`, `DashboardStats.jsx`, `UserProfile.jsx`)**

      * **Purpose:** These components serve as placeholders for the detailed content of each nested route.
      * **`ProjectList.jsx`**: Renders `DashboardSummary` and will eventually list user's projects.
      * **`DashboardStats.jsx`**: Will display portfolio analytics and charts.
      * **`UserProfile.jsx`**: Displays and allows editing of user profile information.
      * **Dependencies:** Each will consume relevant data from their respective Redux slices (`projectsSlice`, `statsSlice`, `profileSlice`).

### 2.2. Redux State Management

  * **`uiSlice.js`:**

      * **Purpose:** Manages UI-specific state directly related to the Dashboard's layout and interaction, preventing clutter in core data slices.
      * **State:**
          * `isAddProjectModalOpen: boolean` (controls visibility of the "Add New Project" modal).
          * `isSidebarOpen: boolean` (controls the mobile sidebar's open/closed state).
      * **Reducers:** `toggleAddProjectModal`, `setAddProjectModalOpen`, `toggleSidebar`, `setSidebarOpen`.
      * **Integration:** Must be added to the Redux store's root reducer.

  * **Other Slices (`authSlice`, `projectsSlice`, `profileSlice`, `statsSlice`):**

      * The Dashboard components primarily *consume* data from these existing slices.
      * `authSlice`: Provides current user details for greetings and avatar.
      * `projectsSlice`: Will provide the array of projects for summary calculations and the `ProjectList` component.
      * `profileSlice`: Will manage user profile details for the `UserProfile` component.
      * `statsSlice`: Will manage aggregated statistics for the `DashboardStats` component.

### 2.3. Routing

The Dashboard uses nested routing via `react-router-dom` to manage its internal sections:

  * The main `Dashboard` component is mapped to `/dashboard/*`.
  * Inside `Dashboard`, `Routes` are defined for:
      * `/dashboard/projects`: Renders `ProjectList` (which includes `DashboardSummary`). This is the default landing page for `/dashboard`.
      * `/dashboard/stats`: Renders `DashboardStats`.
      * `/dashboard/profile`: Renders `UserProfile`.

### 2.4. Styling & UI Library

  * **Tailwind CSS:** Used extensively for flexible grid/flexbox layouts, responsive design, spacing, typography, and color schemes, ensuring a professional and consistent look.
  * **Shadcn UI:** Provides accessible and customizable UI components (`Card`, `Button`, `Avatar`, `DropdownMenu`, `Sheet`, `Dialog`, `Input`, `Label`), streamlining development and maintaining a modern aesthetic.
  * **Lucide React:** Integrated for a comprehensive set of scalable vector icons, enhancing visual clarity across the interface.

## 3\. Backend Specifications

The Dashboard primarily relies on data already residing in your Supabase database (`user_profiles` and `projects` tables). For optimal performance, especially for the `DashboardSummary`, a dedicated aggregate GraphQL query is proposed.

### 3.1. Dashboard Data Retrieval

To efficiently provide the summary metrics, a new GraphQL query `dashboardOverview` is proposed.

**GraphQL Type Definition:**

```graphql
type DashboardOverview {
  totalProjects: Int!
  projectsInProgress: Int!
  lastUpdatedProjectTitle: String
  lastUpdatedProjectDate: String # ISO 8601 string
}
```

**GraphQL Query:**

```graphql
extend type Query {
  dashboardOverview(userId: ID!): DashboardOverview
}
```

  * **Purpose:** This query is designed to fetch only the required aggregate data (total projects, projects in progress, last updated project details) directly from the database using efficient SQL aggregations. This avoids over-fetching all project records when only summary information is needed.
  * **Data Sources:** The `projects` table (for project counts and details) and potentially the `user_profiles` table (for user's full name, if not available from `authSlice`).

### 3.2. Security & Performance

  * **Security (Access Control - Supabase RLS):**

      * **Crucial:** All data displayed on the dashboard must be exclusively for the authenticated user.
      * Supabase's Row-Level Security (RLS) is essential for enforcing this. Policies must be configured on the `projects` table to ensure users can only interact with rows where the `user_id` matches their authenticated `auth.uid()`. Similar RLS should be applied to `user_profiles` to restrict access to a user's own profile data. This robust, database-level security ensures data isolation.

  * **Performance:**

      * **Quick Initial Render:** The Dashboard's core layout and the `DashboardSummary` are optimized for fast loading, thanks to the dedicated `dashboardOverview` query which minimizes data transfer.
      * **Delegated Data Fetching:** Detailed and potentially heavy data fetching (e.g., for the comprehensive `ProjectList` or complex `DashboardStats`) is performed by their respective sub-components only when those sections are actively viewed. This prevents the main dashboard from being burdened by unnecessary initial data loads.
      * **Database Indexing:** To ensure the proposed `dashboardOverview` query remains highly efficient, especially with a growing number of projects, it's critical to create appropriate database indexes on the `projects` table. For example:
          * `CREATE INDEX idx_projects_user_id_status ON projects (user_id, status);`
          * `CREATE INDEX idx_projects_user_id_updated_at ON projects (user_id, updated_at DESC);`
            These indexes will significantly accelerate the `COUNT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` operations for individual user data.

## 4\. Setup and Usage Instructions

To integrate and run the Dashboard module:

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure all required frontend libraries are installed:

    ```bash
    npm install react react-dom react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-router-dom tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer shadcn-ui lucide-react sonner
    # For Shadcn UI, follow their installation guide to initialize components if not already done.
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add avatar button card dialog dropdown-menu input label sheet toaster
    ```

2.  **Redux Store Configuration:**

      * Ensure `uiSlice.reducer` is added to your Redux store (e.g., in `src/store/index.js`):
        ```javascript
        import uiReducer from './slices/uiSlice';
        // ...
        reducer: {
          auth: authReducer,
          ui: uiReducer,
          // ... other reducers
        }
        ```
      * Verify your `authSlice`, `projectsSlice`, `profileSlice`, and `statsSlice` are correctly defined and integrated, as the Dashboard components will consume data from them.

3.  **Place Components:**

      * Place the provided `.jsx` files in their respective `src/components/` and `src/store/slices/` directories.
      * Ensure Shadcn UI components (e.g., `card.jsx`, `avatar.jsx`) are available in `src/components/ui/` or configured as per your Shadcn setup.

4.  **Update `App.jsx`:**

      * Import the `Dashboard` component.
      * Modify the `/dashboard` route to `path="/dashboard/*"` to enable nested routing, and wrap it with your `ProtectedRoute` component.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```jsx
    // src/App.jsx
    import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
    // ...
    <Route
      path="/dashboard/*"
      element={
        <ProtectedRoute>
          <Dashboard />
        </ProtectedRoute>
      }
    />
    ```

5.  **Backend Data:**

      * Confirm your Supabase `projects` and `user_profiles` tables are set up with appropriate columns (e.g., `user_id`, `status`, `updated_at`, `created_at`, `title`, `completion_date`).
      * Implement the `dashboardOverview` GraphQL query on your backend/GraphQL API layer to fetch aggregate data efficiently, ensuring it respects RLS.
      * Ensure RLS policies are active and correctly configured for your `projects` and `user_profiles` tables in Supabase.
      * Add necessary database indexes for performance.

6.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    Navigate to `/signin` to log in, and you will be redirected to the `/dashboard`.
